# Submission Guidelines

Before you submit your Pull Request (homework submission), please consider following guidelines.

* Pull request description - overview of your work (describe as much as you can)
* Pass all provided unit tests (check using `gradle check` or just simply see your pull request with a green icon!)
* Avoid monolithic class (e.g. a class with 1k lines of code)
* Indent your code properly (consistency is what I ask, 2 space, 4 space or hard tab)
* Suggest some improvements! (We can always improve more on next assignments)
* Name your variable properly (consider `g` vs `chessBoard`)
* Unit test your implementation! [Optional]
* Document your code (at least the non-trivial ones) [Optional]
